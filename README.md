# ML_CLASSIFICATION_ALGORITHMS
Breast Cancer Classification using various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, SVC, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and KNN for performance comparison and analysis.

# Project Overview

This project aims to classify breast cancer data into malignant or benign categories using a variety of machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project is the **Breast Cancer dataset** from the sklearn library. The goal is to evaluate the performance of different classification models, including **Logistic Regression**, **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**, **Decision Tree Classifier**, **Random Forest Classifier**, and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.

The project involves several key steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The dataset is loaded, cleaned, and preprocessed. This includes handling any missing values, performing feature scaling, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Implementation**: Various classification algorithms are implemented and trained on the training data to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

3. **Model Evaluation**: The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. The best-performing model is determined based on these evaluations.

4. **Results Analysis**: The performance of all models is compared to identify the most effective algorithm for this classification task.

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to real-world problems, with a focus on classification and model performance analysis. The models are evaluated to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different algorithms for the breast cancer classification task.
